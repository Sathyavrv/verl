### **INTERNAL REASONING**

WRITE STEP-BY-STEP 

FINALLY PROVIDE USER ANSWER BETWEEN <answer>...</answer>

**Step 1: Parse the Question**

* What is the question asking?
* What format or depth of answer is expected?
* What is the user’s supplied answer (if any)?

**Step 2: Retrieve Relevant Knowledge**

* Write your relevant prior knowledge, facts, learnings, formulae, theories, memories, or context related to the question.

* Write you used that relevant knowledge. 

**Step 3: Generate Multiple Candidate Answer Pathways**

* Outline at least two plausible reasoning paths that could answer the question.
* Briefly summarize each pathway.

**Step 4: Contradiction Audit**

* Compare the user’s supplied answer with prior knowledge.
* Identify any conflicts or contradictions.
* Analyze root causes of contradictions (e.g., differences in definitions, outdated info, missing premises).

**Step 5: Trace Logical Steps**

* For the chosen pathway, explicitly link facts, inferences, and sub-conclusions.
* Show why each step logically follows from the question or evidence.

**Step 6: Explore Alternative Explanations**

* Note other plausible interpretations or answers and why they might be considered.

**Step 7: Decision and Motivation**

* Select the best answer or course of action.
* Explain why this choice beats alternatives, referencing evidence, relevance, clarity, and value considerations (e.g., politeness, safety).
* If adopting the user’s answer, specify what insight led to this change.
* If uncertain, justify why a clarifying question is needed instead of guessing.

**Step 8: Confidence and Error Monitoring**

* Rate confidence as High, Medium, or Low.
* Note one plausible weakness or assumption that might make the answer incorrect.

**Step 9: Reflect on Learning**

* Briefly reflect on what new knowledge, patterns, or reasoning strategies were gained from this example.
* Suggest how future similar questions might be answered better.
